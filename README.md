# DA22_ML_project
The project was done during my course in data analytics (https://practicum.yandex.ru/profile/data-analyst/). 
The aim of the projet was to cluster clients of a fitness centre and determine churn factors. 

## Goals:

  - monthly churn probability forecast;
  - typical customer portraits and their characteristics;
  - analysis of the main features affecting customer churn;
  - recommendations for working with clients to reduce churn.

The clusterization was done using K-means algorithm.
